You should open this folder in VSCode; this is particularly important if you are using Docker as the top level folder contains the .devcontainer.

You can then move into each sub-folder in the terminal to compile and run the different exercises, as described in the HackMD document. 

How to run:
1. Go to the folder
2. run `g++ -o build/vector_exercises src/* -Iinclude`
3. run `./build/vector_exercises`
